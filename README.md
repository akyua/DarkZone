## How to create a new Post

To create a new post, navigate to the posts folder within the project. Inside, create a new .md file. While it's not mandatory, it's a good practice to name the file after the post's title for better organization.

At the beginning of the file, you must include and fill in the following information:

```
---
title: 'How to use GIT'
slug: 'how-to-use-git'
date: '2025-09-09'
author: 'Gabriel Silveira'
category: 'GIT'
---
```

After adding this information, you can freely write the content of your post. Feel free to use the existing posts as examples.
